# Stimulus-presentation-code-Oxazepam-and-emotion
Code and materials used to present stimuli to participants in a research project

This repository contains code and associated files for the following:
1. A reaction time test
2. An experimental paradigm for empathy for pain (2 versions, wave 1 and wave 2)
3. An experimental paradigm for emotional contagion (wave 1 and wave 2)
4. A Swedish translation of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory

The experiments will be described in forthcoming papers, to which we will link when they are available.
