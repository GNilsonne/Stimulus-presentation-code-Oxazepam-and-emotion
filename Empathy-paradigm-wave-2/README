This folder contains the files necessary to run an experiment on empathy for pain. 
Code is written for the Presentation software (Neurobahavioral Systems, USA).
Presentation needs the .sce and .pcl files in order to execute the experiment. 
The software should be configured to ask for user input, and either "EP1a" or "EP1b" should be enrered in order to call one of these two counterbalanced trial lists, giving the stimulus sequence.
